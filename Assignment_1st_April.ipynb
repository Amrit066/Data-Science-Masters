    "- Linear regression is used to predict continuous numerical values, such as predicting the price of a house based on its features like size, number of rooms, location, etc. The model tries to fit a line or hyperplane through the data points to minimize the sum of the squared errors between the predicted and actual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the other hand, logistic regression is used to predict binary categorical outcomes, such as whether a customer will buy a product or not, based on certain features like age, gender, income, etc. The model tries to fit a logistic function (S-shaped curve) through the data points to estimate the probability of the outcome being true or false.\n",

    "An example of a scenario where logistic regression would be more appropriate than linear regression is in predicting whether a patient has a certain disease or not based on their medical history, age, sex, and other relevant features. The outcome of interest is binary (either the patient has the disease or not), and we want to estimate the probability of having the disease based on the available features. In this case, a logistic regression model would be more appropriate as it can model the probability of the outcome being true or false based on the input features, while a linear regression model would not be suitable as it can only predict continuous numerical values."

    "- The cost function used in logistic regression is the binary cross-entropy or log loss function, which measures the difference between the predicted probability and the actual binary class label of each data point. \n",

    "- In logistic regression, regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting of the model. Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and fits the training data too well, resulting in poor performance on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are two types of regularization techniques used in logistic regression: L1 regularization and L2 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. L1 regularization, also known as Lasso regularization, adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the absolute value of the model coefficients. This technique encourages the model to set some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection and reducing the number of features used in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. L2 regularization, also known as Ridge regularization, adds a penalty term to the cost function that is proportional to the square of the model coefficients. This technique shrinks the coefficients towards zero but does not set them exactly to zero, so all features are retained in the model but with reduced weights.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "Regularization helps prevent overfitting by reducing the complexity of the model, which in turn reduces the variance of the model. By reducing the variance, the model becomes less sensitive to small fluctuations in the training data, and it performs better on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of regularization applied to the model is controlled by a regularization parameter, which determines the trade-off between the fit to the training data and the complexity of the model. A larger regularization parameter results in a simpler model with smaller coefficients and less overfitting, but with reduced accuracy on the training data. Conversely, a smaller regularization parameter results in a more complex model with larger coefficients and better accuracy on the training data, but with increased risk of overfitting. The optimal value of the regularization parameter can be found using techniques such as cross-validation."

    "Imbalanced datasets are a common problem in logistic regression when the number of observations in one class is significantly larger or smaller than the other class. Here are some common strategies for handling imbalanced datasets in logistic regression:\n",

    "1. Resampling techniques: \n",
    "- Resampling techniques involve either undersampling the majority class or oversampling the minority class to balance the dataset. \n",
    "- Random undersampling can be used to remove some observations from the majority class, while random oversampling can be used to duplicate some observations from the minority class. \n",

    "3. Threshold adjustment: \n",
    "- The probability threshold for classification can be adjusted to achieve the desired balance between precision and recall. Lowering the threshold can increase sensitivity and recall but may reduce precision, while increasing the threshold can increase precision but may reduce sensitivity and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Cost-sensitive learning: \n",
