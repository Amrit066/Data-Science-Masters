    "- The decision tree classifier is a machine learning algorithm used for both regression and classification tasks. \n",
    "- It is a supervised learning algorithm that uses a tree-like model to make decisions by learning simple rules from the data features.\n",
    "- Decision trees have several advantages, such as being easy to interpret and visualize, handling both numerical and categorical data, and being able to capture nonlinear relationships between the features and the target variable. However, they can also suffer from overfitting and instability due to high variance, which can be addressed using ensemble methods such as random forests or gradient boosting.\n",

    "##### Part-2:<br><br>\n",
    "- The algorithm builds a decision tree by recursively splitting the data based on the most informative features. - At each node of the tree, the algorithm selects the feature that provides the most information gain, which is the reduction in entropy or impurity of the target variable after splitting the data based on that feature. \n",
    "- Entropy is a measure of the randomness or unpredictability of the target variable, and impurity measures how well the target variable is separated by the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The decision tree splits the data into subsets or branches, with each branch representing a value or category of the target variable. \n",
    "- This process is repeated recursively for each branch until a stopping criterion is met, such as reaching a maximum depth, minimum number of samples, or minimum impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once the tree is built, it can be used to make predictions on new data by following the path down the tree based on the values of the features until a leaf node is reached, which corresponds to a prediction of the target variable."

    "Here is a step-by-step explanation of the mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with the entire dataset and select the feature that provides the best split. The best split is the one that results in the highest information gain or the lowest impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Split the dataset based on the selected feature into two or more subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Repeat the process on each subset until a stopping criterion is met. The stopping criterion could be a certain depth of the tree, a minimum number of samples per leaf, or a maximum impurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Each subset that cannot be split anymore is called a leaf node, which represents a decision or prediction based on the features of the samples in that subset.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. To make a prediction for a new sample, start at the root node of the tree and traverse down the branches based on the values of the features in the sample, until we reach a leaf node. The prediction is the class or label associated with the leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The impurity or entropy is calculated at each node to determine the best feature to split on. Impurity measures how mixed or varied the labels are in a given subset. The goal is to minimize the impurity at each node to create the most informative splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The information gain is calculated as the difference between the impurity of the parent node and the weighted average of the impurities of the child nodes. The feature that results in the highest information gain is selected as the best feature to split on.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Once the decision tree is built, it can be pruned to avoid overfitting by removing nodes that do not improve the performance on a validation set."

    "A decision tree classifier can be used to solve a binary classification problem by recursively splitting the data based on the values of the input features until the final leaves of the tree represent the predicted output class. Here are the steps involved:\n",

    "1. Start with the entire dataset and calculate the impurity of the target variable (e.g. entropy or Gini index).\n",
