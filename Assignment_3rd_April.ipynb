    "Multiclass classification is a type of classification problem where the goal is to predict the class or category of a sample when there are more than two possible classes. This is in contrast to binary classification, where there are only two possible classes. In multiclass classification, the model must assign a sample to one of several possible classes, whereas in binary classification, the model must assign a sample to one of two classes.\n",

    "- Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm that can be extended to handle multiclass classification problems through various techniques. \n",
    "- One such technique is the one-vs-all (OVA) or one-vs-rest (OVR) approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the OVA approach, we train K binary logistic regression models where K is the number of classes. \n",
    "- In each model, we consider one class as the positive class and the rest of the classes as the negative class. For example, if we have three classes A, B, and C, we would train three binary logistic regression models: A vs (B, C), B vs (A, C), and C vs (A, B).\n",
