    "- Encoding of data from categorical to numerical is important as it helps the different machine learning algorithms to be able to process those data. Machine learning models works on the numerical sets of data, that's why it's needed to convert any categorical data (if present) in the dataset to numerical form using appropriate encoding techniques."
